# The Pirates of Braazenhold - A one Page Dungeon

## Summary

The players are looking for a fabled treasure of a legandary pirate Zdruvlep out in the bloodwarm waters of the sea
There is much glory in this venture, but beware!

## Entrance Gaurdian

The Island of Zdruvlep's location has been revealed to you, but it's a far off in dangerous waters, and the players need special equipment and a skilled captain - or a ship of their own - to reach it. Thankfully, the pirate dens and royal navy around them may have an optoin, but won't give it willingly.

### Options for the party
* Promise the grungey sea captain some of your prize, but he'll take convincing if he won't take a royal fortune off of you
* Talk the royal navy into support for you exhibition - after all, Zdruvlep looted some of the Empire's most precious goods!
* Steal or buy a skip from the port, and try and sial it there yourself (Hard sailing skillcheck)

Once you find a way, you get to the location of Zdruv's cursed island - the small island forms a cove around an additional island, and you can see the busted and eerie remnants of the famed captains ship. Onside the main island of the crescent is a small raised rocky hill, in which seems to be built an Elder people temple. Perhaps this is where the treasure waits?

## Puzzles

A jaunt through an enchanted jungle where you find a guidestone, and it gives you directions to find a way out - but it's somesort of math riddle! You must trick your way into getting out of the clearing that has 3 entrances and exits, and this well get you to the temple. The air feels thick and mysterious, and the world seems disconnected. You can no longer hear the sea.

_Alternatively, the players with a high **Survival** or **Wilderness** check may attempt to navigate through the jungle itself and outsmart the enchantments, a **Very Hard task**. If they fail more than once, make it clear the enchantments are too strong for normal Outdoorsmanship to overcome._

## The Setback

As you finish the puzzle and emerges near the top of the stone hill, you see the ship you came in is now in flames and sinking to the ocean floor! Skeleton pirates have animated and attacked it, leaving all but a handful of your shipmates to a watery grave. Now that you are out of the mystical jungle, the way towards the ghost ship has been found. 

_If the players have much invested in a ship already or it's a major part of a campaign, instead make it an attack on your ship that leaves it intact, but damaged in a way that'll take a while to repair - for instance, cutting the guideropes or wrecking the masts._


## Big Climax

The ghost ship is very strange - it feels like it's composed of floatsam vet very sturdy. Odd metal tentacles seem to flow in and out of the wood, as if some chrome vines have come to consume the ship. Many of the tentacles connect to the where the steering wheel would be, which is noticeably missing. The ship has two major levels - the deck and the lower level. The lower levels contains an empty storehouse, bunkbeds for the absent crew, and places for canons and weapons. The deck also has an entrance to the captains quarters.

The captain quarters appears to be the dread pirates resting place. The man is laying upon his captains deck, with an old looking obsidian dagger plunged through his chest. Arranged in front of him are four former crewmates bowed in front of him, seemingly in worship, and have been run through with spears. If you lift the dagger out, the captain re-animates, as do the four crewman, and the engage to fight you!

If the players suceed, then you can take the dagger and use it as a key for **The Eldren Tomb**.

When you try and grab the treasure, the captain animates and raises to fight you, along with his crew! Fight on **Great Undead** and 4 **Swarming Skeleton Pirates**.
